# Customer_churn_dataset_analysis
A machine learning activity called "customer churn prediction" looks for clients who are most likely to discontinue utilizing a business's offerings. 

Businesses can use prediction models to comprehend consumer behavior and implement preventative steps to increase retention by using previous data. 
Customer demographics, account information, service usage, and monthly fees are usually included in the dataset. 
To categorize customers as likely to churn or not, the project entails feature scaling, data preprocessing, and the use of machine learning methods such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression. 
In order to guarantee accurate predictions and assist businesses in making data-driven decisions to lower churn rates, the model is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
